Unit-2 Notion of Proof NAVRACHNA UNIVERSITY B.TECH. CSE SEMESTER III A.Y. 2023-24

Introduction • Formally, a theorem is a statement that can be shown to be true. In  mathematical writing, the term theorem is usually reserved for a  statement that is considered at least somewhat important. • Less important theorems sometimes are called propositions. • A theorem may be the universal quantification of a conditional statement  with one or more premises and a conclusion. • We demonstrate that a theorem is true with a proof. A proof is a valid  argument that establishes the truth of a theorem.

Introduction • The statements used in a proof can include axioms (or postulates), which are  statements we assume to be true the premises, if any, of the theorem, and  previously proven theorems. • A less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results is called a  lemma (plural lemmas or lemmata). • A corollary is a theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that  has been proved. • A conjecture is a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement,  usually on the basis of some partial evidence, a heuristic argument, or the  intuition of an expert.

Direct Proof • A direct proof shows that a conditional statement p → q is true by  showing that if p is true, then q must also be true, so that the  combination p true and q false never occurs.

Direct Proof • Definition: The integer n is even if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k,  and n is odd if there exists an integer k such that n = 2k + 1. • Example: Give a direct proof of the theorem “If n is an odd integer, then n2 is odd.” • Solution: Let P(n): 𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟and Q(n): 𝑛2 𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟. To prove: ∀𝑛, 𝑃𝑛 →𝑄𝑛 By direct proof, if ∀𝑛P(n) is true  →𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑 →𝑛= 2𝑘+ 1, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑘∈𝑍 →𝑛2 = 2𝑘+ 1 2, 𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠 →𝑛= 4𝑘2 + 4𝑘+ 1 = 2 2𝑘2 + 2𝑘+ 1 →𝑛= 2𝑚+ 1 , 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑚= 2𝑘2 + 2𝑘∈𝑍 →𝑛2 𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑→Q n is true Thus ∀𝑛, 𝑃𝑛 →𝑄𝑛.

Exercise  • Definition: If a divides b then b is multiple of a, i.e. 𝑏= 𝑎𝑘𝑘∈𝑍. • Exercise: Let a, b and c be integers, directly prove that if a divides b and a  divides c then a also divides b + c. • Solution: Predicate (p): a divides b and c , Conclusion (q): a divides (b+c) To prove 𝑝→𝑞. By direct proof, if p is true →𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑐 →𝑏= 𝑎𝑘, 𝑐= 𝑎𝑙, 𝑘, 𝑙∈𝑍 →𝑏+ 𝑐= 𝑎𝑘+ 𝑎𝑙= 𝑎𝑘+ 𝑙= 𝑎𝑚, 𝑚= 𝑘+ 𝑙∈𝑍 →𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑏+ 𝑐→𝑞𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒. Thus 𝑝→𝑞

Exercise  • Directly prove that if m and n are odd integers then mn is also an odd integer. • Proof: 𝑝: 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠, 𝑞: 𝑚𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 To prove 𝑝→𝑞 By direct proof, if p is true →𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑜𝑑𝑑 →𝑚= 2𝑘+ 1 , 𝑛= 2𝑙+ 1, 𝑘, 𝑙∈𝑍 →𝑚𝑛= 2𝑘+ 1 2𝑙+ 1 = 4𝑘𝑙+ 2𝑘+ 2𝑙+ 1 = 2 2𝑘𝑙+ 𝑘+ 𝑙+ 1 →𝑚𝑛= 2𝑟+ 1, 𝑟= 2𝑘𝑙+ 𝑘+ 𝑙∈𝑍 →𝑚𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑 →𝑞𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 Thus 𝑝→𝑞.

Exercise  • Definition: An integer m is a perfect square if 𝑚= 𝑘2 for some integer k • Let m and n be integers. Directly prove that if m and n are perfect squares then  mn is also a perfect square. • Proof: 𝑝: 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠, 𝑞: 𝑚𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 To prove 𝑝→𝑞 By direct proof, if p is true →𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑠 →𝑚= 𝑘2, 𝑛= 𝑙2, 𝑘, 𝑙∈𝑍 →𝑚𝑛= 𝑘2𝑙2 = 𝑘𝑙2 = 𝑟2, 𝑟= 𝑘𝑙2 ∈𝑍 →𝑚𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠𝑞𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑒 →𝑞𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 Thus 𝑝→𝑞. 

Exercise • Definition: The real number r is rational if there exist integers p and q with  q≠0 such that r = p/q. A real number that is not rational is called irrational. • Prove that the sum of two rational numbers is rational. • Proof: 𝑝: 𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙, 𝑞: 𝑚+ 𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 To prove p →𝑞 𝑝: 𝑚= 𝑎 𝑏, 𝑛= 𝑐 𝑑 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑∈𝑍, 𝑏≠0, 𝑑≠0 and  𝑞: 𝑚+ 𝑛= 𝑘 𝑙, 𝑘, 𝑙∈𝑍, 𝑙≠0 𝑚+ 𝑛= 𝑎 𝑏+ 𝑐 𝑑= 𝑎𝑑+𝑐𝑏 𝑏𝑑 = 𝑘 𝑙, 𝑘= 𝑎𝑑+ 𝑐𝑏, 𝑙= 𝑏𝑑 Here 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑∈𝑍, 𝑏≠0, 𝑑≠0. So, 𝑘, 𝑙∈𝑍, 𝑙≠0 Hence 𝑚+ 𝑛is rational, i.e. 𝑞is true. Thus 𝑝→𝑞.

Exercise  Prove directly that  1. If n is an even integer then 7n + 4 is an even integer.  2. If m is an even integer and n is an odd integer then m + n is an odd  integer.  3. If m is an even integer and n is an odd integer then mn is an even  integer 4. Sum of two odd integers is even. 5. If a,b, c ∈N, then lcm(ca, cb) = c ·lcm(a,b) 6. Let x and y be positive numbers. If x ≤ y, then 𝑥≤ 𝑦(Prove  without taking square root on both sides).

Proof by Contraposition • Proofs of theorems of this type that are not direct proofs, that is, that  do not start with the premises and end with the conclusion, are called  indirect proofs. • An extremely useful type of indirect proof is known as proof by  contraposition. • Proofs by contraposition make use of the fact that the conditional  statement p → q is equivalent to its contrapositive, ￢q →￢p. 

Exercise • Prove that if n is an integer and 3n + 2 is odd, then n is odd. • Proof: Let 𝑝: 3𝑛+ 2 𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑, 𝑞: 𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑 To prove: 𝑝→𝑞(direct proof not possible) or ~𝑞→~𝑝(contrapositive) ~𝑝: 3𝑛+ 2 𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛, ~𝑞: 𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 By contrapositive proof, if ~𝑞is true  →𝑛𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 →𝑛= 2𝑘 𝑘∈𝑍 →3𝑛= 6𝑘 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏𝑦3 𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠 →3𝑛+ 2 = 6𝑘+ 2 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔2 𝑏𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠 →3𝑛+ 2 = 2 3𝑘+ 1 = 2𝑟 𝑟= 3𝑘+ 1 ∈𝑍 →3𝑛+ 2 𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 →~𝑝𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒 Hence ~𝑞→~𝑝or 𝑝→𝑞.

Exercise • Prove by contraposition that If 7x+9 is even, then x is odd. Proof:  • Suppose x is not odd.  • Thus x is even, so x = 2a for some integer a.  • Then 7𝑥+ 9 = 7(2𝑎) + 9 = 14𝑎+ 8 + 1 = 2(7𝑎+ 4) + 1.  • Therefore 7𝑥+ 9 = 2𝑏+ 1, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑏𝑖𝑠𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑟7𝑎+ 4.  • Consequently 7𝑥+ 9 𝑖𝑠𝑜𝑑𝑑. Therefore 7𝑥+ 9 𝑖𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛.

Exercise • Prove by contraposition that If 𝑥2 −6𝑥+ 5 is even, then x is odd. Proof:  • Suppose 𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑑.  • Thus 𝑥𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛, so 𝑥= 2𝑎for some integer 𝑎.  • So 𝑥2 −6𝑥+ 5 = 2𝑎2 −6 2𝑎+ 5 = 4𝑎2 −12𝑎+ 5 = 4𝑎2 −12𝑎+ 4 + 1 = 2(2𝑎2 −6𝑎+ 2) + 1.  • Therefore 𝑥2 −6𝑥+ 5 = 2𝑏+ 1, where b is the integer 2𝑎2 −6𝑎+ 2. Consequently 𝑥2 −6𝑥+ 5 is odd.  • Therefore 𝑥2 −6𝑥+ 5 is not even

Exercise 1. Show that by Contraposition: For any integer k, prove if 3k + 1 is even,  then k is odd. 2. Show that by Contraposition: For any integers a and b, a + b ≥ 15  implies that a ≥ 8 or b ≥ 8. 3. Show that by Contraposition if n is a positive integer such that the  sum of its positive divisors is n+1 then n is prime. 4. Suppose 𝑥, 𝑦∈𝑅. Prove by contraposition: If 𝑦3 + 𝑦𝑥2 ≤𝑥3 + 𝑥𝑦2 ,  then y ≤ x. 5. Prove by contraposition: Suppose 𝑥, 𝑦∈𝑍. If 5 ∤𝑥𝑦, then 5 ∤𝑥and  5 ∤𝑦.

Proofs by Contradiction • The statement r ∧￢r is a contradiction whenever r is a proposition,  we can prove that p is true if we can show that ￢p → (r ∧￢r) is true  for some proposition r.  • Proofs of this type are called proofs by contradiction. • Start with assuming p → ~r to be true and find a contradiction to p  which will lead to conclusion p →r.

Prove that 2 is irrational by giving a proof of contradiction. Proof: Suppose that 2 is rational.  (We will show this leads to contradiction) Then 2 = 𝑎 𝑏where 𝑎, 𝑏∈𝑍such that 𝑎and 𝑏have no common factors. Squaring both sides, we get  2 = 𝑎2 𝑏2 →2𝑏2 = 𝑎2 →𝑎2 𝑖𝑠𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑜𝑓2 𝑖. 𝑒. 𝑎2 𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 →𝑎𝑖𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 →𝑎= 2𝑘, 𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑘∈𝑍 →2𝑏2 = 2𝑘2 →𝑏2 = 2𝑘2 →𝑏2 𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛→𝑏𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛 But now a and b both are even. So a and b have a common factor 2 which is  contradiction to the statement a and b have no common factors. Hence our initial assumption that 2 is rational is false. Thus 2 is irrational

Exercise  • Prove by contradiction: 1. If 𝑥= 2 then 3𝑥−5 ≠10. 2. If a,b,c are all odd integers, then 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥+ 𝑐= 0 cannot have  rational solution. 3. If ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶then measures of each base angles cannot be 92°. 4. If ∠𝐴& ∠𝐵are complementary then ∠𝐴≤90°.
